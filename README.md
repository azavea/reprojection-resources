# Reprojection Resources

Resources for using non-web-mercator projections with Mapbox GL JS

## Description

While working on Covid-19 related maps, I encountered situations where a different map projection would be handy, where we are showing data at a national or worldwide scale. Mapbox GL is limited to web mercator, but it is possible to reproject coordinates into web mercator in a way that looks like a different projection. This repository brings together scripts, tools, and demos help accomplish that affect.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- `npm install -g dirty-reprojectors`
